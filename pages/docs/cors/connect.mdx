## Database Connections and Setup

In `verse.db`, we use the built-in `.connect` method to establish connections to databases. Let's dive into the key options and how to use them effectively.

### Adapter Selection

The **adapter** option is crucial for defining the type of database you want to connect to. You can choose from the following adapters:

1. **JSON**: Use `"json"` as the adapter value.
2. **YAML**: Specify `"yaml"` for the YAML adapter.
3. **SQL**: For SQL databases, set the adapter to `"sql"`.

Here's an example of connecting to a JSON database:

```javascript
const db = new versedb.connect({
  adapter: "json",
});
```

You can also create multiple connections simultaneously, each with a different adapter:

```javascript
const jsonDb = new versedb.connect({
  adapter: "json",
});

const yamlDb = new versedb.connect({
  adapter: "yaml",
});

const sqlDb = new versedb.connect({
  adapter: "sql",
});
```

  Currently, we support three adapters: `json`, `yaml`, and `sql`. Expect more adapters in future updates.
</Callout>

### Data Path Configuration

The **dataPath** option specifies the directory where your data resides. Set it to the appropriate path:

```javascript
const db = new versedb.connect({
  adapter: "adapter", // Choose the desired adapter (json, yaml, or sql)
  dataPath: "./path/to/the/data/folder", // Specify the path to the data directory (a folder)
});
```

### Developer Logs

Our database includes a flexible logger system that you can enable or disable for each connection. Here's how to configure it:

```javascript
const db = new versedb.connect({
  adapter: "adapter", // Choose the desired adapter (json, yaml, or sql)
  dataPath: "./path/to/the/data/folder", // Specify the path to the data directory (a folder)
  devLogs: {
    enable: true, // Set to true to enable dev logs (writes logs to files in the logs folder)
    path: "./path/to/the/logs/folder", // Specify the logs folder path
  },
});
```

The logger system can also be used externally. Refer to the Logger System page for further details.

### Secure Data (Encryption)

To enhance security and reduce data file sizes, we provide a built-in encoder and encryptor. By default, we use the secret key `"versedb"` for encryption. However, you can set your own secret:

```javascript
const db = new versedb.connect({
  adapter: "adapter", // Choose the desired adapter (json, yaml, or sql)
  dataPath: "./path/to/the/data/folder", // Specify the path to the data directory (a folder)
  devLogs: {
    enable: true, // Set to true to enable dev logs (writes logs to files in the logs folder)
    path: "./path/to/the/logs/folder", // Specify the logs folder path
  },
  encryption: {
    enable: true,
    secret: "put-your-secret-here", // Set your custom secret
  },
});
```

Feel free to explore these options and tailor your `verse.db` connections to your specific needs! 🚀
