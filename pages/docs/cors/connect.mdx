# Database Connections and Setup

In `verse.db` we are using our built-in `.connect` to let you connect to a database. And we have until now some nice options for out database that is being improved with time.

### Adapter(s)
our first and the most important option, The `adapter` option. <br />
here in the adapter option you can use it to select the adapter you want 

For Example:
```js showLineNumbers copy {2}
const db = new versedb.connect({
  adapter: "json", // Specify the 'json' adapter
});
```
of course you just should select only one adapter in the single connection.
you can make a multiple connections in the same time with the next example:
```js showLineNumbers copy {2,5,8}
const jsonDb = new versedb.connect({
  adapter: "json", // Specify the 'json' adapter
});
const yamlDb = new versedb.connect({
  adapter: "yaml", // Specify the 'json' adapter
});
const sqlDb = new versedb.connect({
  adapter: "sql", // Specify the 'json' adapter
});
```
<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Until now we only have 3 adapters which is `json`, `yaml` and `sql`. and they are going to be more in the next updates.
</Callout>

### Data Path
This is the second most important option in our database connection options. <br />
selectign the path of the connection to use with `dataPath` option

For Example: 
```js copy showLineNumbers {3}
const db = new versedb.connect({
  adapter: "adapter", // the adapter (json, ymal or sql)
  dataPath: "./path/to/the/data/folder", // here you type the path to the data direction which is a folder 
});
```

### Dev Logs
we have a logger system which can be easily enabled/disabled with each connection.<be />

For Example:
```js copy showLineNumbers {4-7}
const db = new versedb.connect({
  adapter: "adapter", // the adapter (json, ymal or sql)
  dataPath: "./path/to/the/data/folder", // here you type the path to the data direction which is a folder 
  devLogs: {
    enable: true | false, // here you can set the dev logs to true to let the database write logs in a files in the logs folder
    path: "./path/tp/the/logs/folder", // and this is the path to the logs folder
  }
});
```
The logger system also supports using outside the database it-self. just follow the insteractions in the [Logger system page](logger)

### Secure Data (encryption)
we have our special build-in encoder & encryptor which give us more secure for the data and less-sized data files with faster database than ever. <be /> 
we save all the data files for all the adapters in (`.verse`) files 

you can set your own secret for the encryption because we use our defualt secret `versedb` to encrypt the data.
<br />
For Example: 
```js copy showLineNumbers {8-10}
const db = new versedb.connect({
  adapter: "adapter", // the adapter (json, ymal or sql)
  dataPath: "./path/to/the/data/folder", // here you type the path to the data direction which is a folder 
  devLogs: {
    enable: true | false, // here you can set the dev logs to true to let the database write logs in a files in the logs folder
    path: "./path/tp/the/logs/folder", // and this is the path to the logs folder
  },
  encryption: {
    secret: "put-your-secret-here"
  }
});
```
