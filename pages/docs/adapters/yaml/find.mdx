# Find YAML Method

To retrieve specific records from your YAML data, you'll use the `find` method. Here's how you can call it:

```javascript
const results = await db.load(dataname);

console.log(results);
```

The `dataname` parameter represents the filename (without the `.yaml` extension) of the YAML file you want to load. This name is also used when performing other operations like `.add`, `.update`, `.remove`, and `.find` on the corresponding data set.

For example, if you have a YAML file named `users.yaml` containing user data, you'd use the following code to load it:

```javascript
const results = await db.load("users");

console.log(results);
```

## Understanding the Results

The `load` method typically returns an array of objects. Each object in the array corresponds to a single record within the loaded YAML file. Here's what the output looks like:

```yaml
[
  {
    // Object data properties here
  },
  {
    // Object data properties here
  }
  // ... more objects
]
```

- Each object represents a record in your data set.
- The properties within each object contain the data associated with that record.
