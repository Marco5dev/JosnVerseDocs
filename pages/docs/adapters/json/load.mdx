# Using the `load` Method with the `json` Adapter

After successfully establishing a connection to your database (as described in the documentation on Connecting to a Database), you can leverage the `load` method provided by the `json` adapter to interact with your data.

## Overview of the `load` Method

The `load` method allows you to retrieve data from an JSON file. It is a fundamental operation when working with JSON databases, enabling you to access structured information stored in your database files.

### How to Use the `load` Method
<Steps>
### Syntax:
    ```javascript
    const results = await db.load(dataname);
    console.log(results);
    ```
    - Replace `dataname` with the actual filename (without the `.json` extension) of the JSON file you want to load.
    - The `dataname` parameter is also used when performing other operations like `.add`, `.update`, `.remove`, and `.find` on the corresponding data set.

### Example:
    Suppose you have an JSON file named `users.json` containing user data. You'd load it like this:
    ```javascript
    const results = await db.load("users");
    console.log(results);
    ```
    This code fetches the contents of the `users.json` file and stores them in the `results` variable.
</Steps>
### Understanding the Results

The `load` method typically returns an array of objects. Each object in the array corresponds to a single record within the loaded JSON file. This array structure allows you to efficiently manage your data using other provided methods:

- `.add`: Add new objects to the dataset.
- `.update`: Modify existing objects.
- `.remove`: Delete objects.
- `.find`: Search for specific objects.

### Loading Data from Subfolders

The `load` method also supports loading data from subfolders within the `dataPath` directory. To do this, include the subfolder path in the `dataname` parameter, separated by a forward slash (`/`). For example:

```javascript
const results = await db.load("subfolder/dataname");
console.log(results);
```

This will load data from the `dataname.json` file located in the `subfolder`.

### Using Promises (Optional)

If you prefer working with promises instead of `async/await`, you can use the `.then` method on the result of the `load` call:

```javascript
db.load("users")
  .then((results) => {
    console.log(results);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
  });
```

By following these guidelines, you can effectively leverage the `load` method to interact with your JSON data stored using the `json` adapter within your project. Feel free to explore and manipulate your data with confidence! ðŸ˜Š
