# Aggregate

The json aggregate method in this code snippet is designed to perform data aggregation on a given dataset based on a pipeline of stages. Let's break down each operation and its usage:

## Example

```ts
const pipeline = [
  { $match: { age: { $gt: 25 } } }, // Filter documents where age is greater than 25
  { $unwind: "skills" }, // Deconstruct the skills array
  { $group: { _id: "skills", count: { $sum: 1 } } }, // Group by skills and count occurrences
];

const result = await this.aggregate("data", pipeline);

console.log(result.results);
```
