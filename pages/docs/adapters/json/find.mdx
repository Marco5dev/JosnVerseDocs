# Find JSON Method

The `find` method allows you to retrieve specific records from your JSON data. It's useful for querying and filtering data based on specific criteria. Here's how you can use it:

### Syntax

```javascript
const results = await db.find(dataname, query);
```

- `dataname`: The name of the data collection (e.g., `"users"`).
- `query`: An object representing the search criteria. You can specify fields and their corresponding values to filter the data.

### Example

Suppose you have a JSON collection of user data, and you want to find users with the name "Mark Maher." You can use the `find` method like this:

```javascript
const results = await db.find("users", { name: "Mark Maher" });
console.log(results);
```

This will return an array of user objects that match the specified query. Adjust the `dataname` and `query` parameters according to your data structure and search requirements.

Remember to replace `"users"` with the actual name of your data collection and adjust the query criteria as needed. Happy querying! üòäüîç

## Understanding the Results

The find method typically returns an array of objects. Each object in the array corresponds to a single record within the loaded JSON file. Here's what the output looks like:

```json
[
  {
    // Object data properties here
  },
  {
    // Object data properties here
  }
  // ... more objects
]
```

- Each object represents a record in your data set.
- The properties within each object contain the data associated with that record.
