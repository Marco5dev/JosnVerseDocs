# Using the `Find` Method with the `json` Adapter

First After successfully establishing a connection to your database (refer to the documentation on [Connecting to a Database](/docs/introduction/installation)), you can leverage the `load` method provided by the `json` adapter to interact with your data.

### Calling the `Find` Method

```js copy showLineNumbers
const results = await db.load(dataname);

console.log(results);
```

The `dataname` parameter represents the filename (without the `.json` extension) of the JSON file you want to load. This name is also used when performing other operations like `.add`, `.update`, `.remove`, and `.find` on the corresponding data set.

For instance, if you have a JSON file named `users.json` containing user data, you'd use the following code to load it:

```js
const results = await db.load("users");

console.log(results);
```

### the results:

```json
[
  {
    // Object data properties here
  },
  {
    // Object data properties here
  }
  // ... more objects
]
```

The `load` method typically returns an array of objects. Each object in the array corresponds to a single record within the loaded JSON file. This allows you to efficiently manage your data using the provided methods like `.add` (to add new objects), `.update` (to modify existing objects), `.remove` (to delete objects), and `.find` (to search for specific objects).

### Loading Data from Subfolders

The `load` method also supports loading data from subfolders within the `dataPath` directory. To achieve this, simply include the subfolder path in the `dataname` parameter, separated by a forward slash `(/)`. Here's an example:

```js
const results = await db.load("subfolder/dataname");

console.log(results);
```
### Using Promises (Optional)

If you prefer working with promises instead of `async/await`, you can utilize the `.then` method on the result of the `load` call. Here's an illustration:

```js
db.load("users")
  .then((results) => {
    console.log(results);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
  });
```

By following these guidelines, you can effectively leverage the `load` method to interact with your JSON data stored using the `json` adapter within your project.
