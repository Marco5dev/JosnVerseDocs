# Search JSON Method

The `search` method allows you to query your **verse.db** database and retrieve specific records based on specified filters. It's a powerful tool for finding relevant data within your JSON files. Here's how you can use it:

### Syntax

```javascript
const collectionFilters = [
  {
    dataname: "users",
    displayment: 5,
    filter: { age: 30, gender: "male" }, // Search for male users with age 30
  },
  {
    dataname: "products",
    displayment: null, // No limit on displayment
    filter: { category: "electronics", price: { $lt: 500 } }, // Search for electronics products with price less than 500
  },
];

const searchResult = await db.search("/path/to/data folder", collectionFilters);
```

### Parameters

- `collectionFilters`: An array of filter objects, each representing a specific data set (JSON file) to search within. Each filter object contains:
  - `dataname`: The filename (without the `.json` extension) of the JSON file you want to search.
  - `displayment`: The maximum number of records to return (optional; set to `null` for no limit).
  - `filter`: An object specifying the search criteria (e.g., `{ age: 30, gender: "male" }`).

### Return Value

The `search` method returns an object with the following properties:

- `acknowledged`: A boolean indicating whether the operation was successful (`true`) or not (`false`).
- `message`: A descriptive message indicating the outcome of the search (e.g., `"Successfully searched in data for the given query."`).
- `results`: An object containing the search results for each specified data set. The keys correspond to the `dataname` values, and the values are arrays of objects representing the matching records.

```json
{
  "acknowledged": true,
  "message": "Successfully searched in data for the gived query.",
  "results": {
    // Assert the first 5 male users with age 30
    "users": [
      { age: 30, gender: "male" },
      { age: 30, gender: "male" },
      { age: 30, gender: "male" },
      { age: 30, gender: "male" },
      { age: 30, gender: "male" },
    ]
    ,
    "products": [
       // Assert the products that match the filter criteria
       { category: "electronics", price: expect.toBeLessThan(500) }, // this is a test code don't care about it the `expect.toBeLessThan(500)` this just mean that it will be less than 500
    ]
  }
}
```

### Example

In your provided example, we have two filters:

1. **Users Filter**:
   - Search for male users with an age of 30.
   - Retrieve the first 5 matching records from the `"users"` data set.

2. **Products Filter**:
   - Search for electronics products with a price less than 500.
   - Retrieve all matching records from the `"products"` data set.

The `searchResult.results` object will contain the filtered data for both users and products.

#### Outcome
The `search` method efficiently retrieves relevant data based on your specified criteria, allowing you to manage your data effectively within your **verse.db** project.
