# Using the `add` Method with the `json` Adapter

After successfully establishing a connection to your database (refer to the documentation on [Connecting to a Database](/docs/introduction/installation)), you can leverage the `load` method provided by the `json` adapter to interact with your data.

### Calling the `add` Method

adding an object to a data file

```js copy showLineNumbers {8}
const newData = {
  // Object data properties here
};
const dataname = "dataname"; // Replace with the desired dataname
// or
const dataname = "subfolder/dataname"; // Replace with the desired dataname with a subfolder

await db.add(dataname, newData);
```

- The `dataname` parameter represents the filename (without the `.json` extension) of the JSON file you want to load. This name is also used when performing other operations like `.add`, `.update`, `.remove`, and `.find` on the corresponding data set.

### the results:

```json
{
  "acknowledged": true,
  "message": "Data added successfully."
}
```
