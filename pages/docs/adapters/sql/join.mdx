# Join SQL Method

The `join` method allows you to search for data within the same SQL file but across different tables. It's a powerful tool for combining related information and retrieving relevant records. Let's explore how to use it effectively.

## 1. Purpose

The primary purpose of the `join` method is to perform SQL joins across multiple tables. By specifying search conditions and display options, you can retrieve consolidated data based on your criteria.

## 2. Syntax

```javascript
const searchOptions = [
  { table: 'users', query: 'username = "user1"' },
  { table: 'products', query: 'price > 600' },
  { table: 'orders', query: 'quantity > 2' }
];

const displayOptions = {
  page: 1,
  pageSize: 2,
  sortOrder: 'desc',
  displayment: 1,
  groupBy: { column: 'user_id' }
};

const result = await db.join('data', searchOptions, displayOptions);
console.log("Search results:", result.results);
```

## 3. Parameters

- `dataname`: The name of your SQL database.
- `searchOptions`: An array of objects specifying the tables to search (`table`) and the search conditions (`query`).
- `displayOptions`: An object defining how the results should be displayed, including pagination, sorting, and grouping.

## 4. Example

Suppose we have an SQL database with three tables: `users`, `products`, and `orders`. We want to find records that match the following criteria:
- Users with the username "user1"
- Products with a price greater than $600
- Orders with a quantity greater than 2

The `join` method combines data from these tables based on the specified conditions. The resulting JSON output provides relevant information for each table.

## 5. Results

The search results include relevant records grouped by the `user_id`. For example:

```json
{
  "users": [
    [
      { "user_id": 1, "username": "user1", "email": "user1@example.com" }
    ]
  ],
  "products": [
    [
      { "product_id": 1, "product_name": "Laptop", "price": 1200.00 }
    ]
  ],
  "orders": [
    [
      { "order_id": 2, "user_id": 2, "product_id": 2, "quantity": 3 }
    ]
  ]
}
```

Feel free to adapt this example to your specific use case! ðŸ˜Š
