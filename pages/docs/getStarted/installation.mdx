# Installation of the local database

## Creating a database
our recommanded options is to use our `npm create verse.db@latest{:bash}` to create a new database conenction but in [`installing database without create function{:md}`](/docs/cors/connect) you can do everything manual if you want
### Create a new database

First you need to create a new database using the following command

<Tabs items={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash copy
    npm create verse.db@latest
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash copy
    pnpm create verse.db@latest
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash copy
    yarn create verse.db@latest
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash copy
    bun create verse.db@latest
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

you will have to answer this questions to setup the connection...
