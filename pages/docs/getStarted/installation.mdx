# Installation of the local database

<Steps>
### Install the database

First you need to install the package with any way you want from the next commands

```bash copy npm2yarn
npm install verse.db
```

### Set up the database in your code:

- for the `adapter` until now we have `json`, `yaml` and `sql` adapters and we will make more with the next updates.
- `dataPath` the path to the folder of the data 
- `devLogs` the path to the folder of the logs 
- `encryption` the path to the folder of the encryption 
- `backup` the path to the folder of the backup 
 
<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  `dataPath` is for this connection or all of them as you want but we recommand that if you are going to make a multiple connections to speret them each connection in a folder or something like `./data/adapter`.
</Callout>
<Callout type="error" emoji="️🚫">
  We are still working on `backup`.
</Callout>


```js copy showLineNumbers {1,3,10-11}
const versedb = require('verse.db')
// or
import versedb from "versedb";

// Connect to the database
const db = versedb.connect({
  adapter: "json", // Specify the 'json' adapter
  dataPath: "./data", // Path to the directory containing your JSON files
  devLogs: { enable: true, path: "./logs" }, // Enable development logs (optional)
  encryption: { secret: "" }, // Encryption just add your secret to make the data more secure (defualt secret: "versedb")
});
```
</Steps>
