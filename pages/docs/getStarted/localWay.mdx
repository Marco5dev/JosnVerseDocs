# How the local Database Works ?
The local database is working with `fs` from node in the `js` version of `verse.db`. <br/>
and we are using some parsers like `yaml` to save your yaml  codes in our data files with encryption. <br/>
we save the data in (`.verse`) files encoded and secure with less data size and more data storing speed than ever. <br/>
