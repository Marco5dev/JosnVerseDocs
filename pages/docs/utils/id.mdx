# Our ID Generator

we have a nice built-in ID generator that we use to generate unique IDs for our
database.

### Example for our ID after generating

our ID Generator replaces the `x` with some randome chracters and in the same time unique IDs in our adapters there is codes to check if the id is already existes and if it's we handle this by generating another id and using the new id

```yaml
ID: xxxxV-xxxxE-xxxxR-xxxxS-xxxxE
```
