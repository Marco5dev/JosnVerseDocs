# Our ID Generator

At **verse.db**, we've developed a robust built-in **ID generator** that serves as the backbone for creating unique identifiers within our database. These IDs play a crucial role in ensuring data integrity and efficient data management.

### Example of a Generated ID:

Our ID Generator constructs IDs by replacing the `x` placeholders with random characters. These IDs are not only unique but also designed to be easily recognizable. In our adapters, we've implemented additional logic to handle cases where an ID already exists. If a collision occurs, we dynamically generate a new ID to maintain uniqueness.

Here's an example of an ID generated by our system:

```yaml
ID: xxxxV-xxxxE-xxxxR-xxxxS-xxxxE
```

Feel free to explore the power of our ID Generator in your applications, knowing that each ID is carefully crafted to meet your data needs. ðŸš€âœ¨
