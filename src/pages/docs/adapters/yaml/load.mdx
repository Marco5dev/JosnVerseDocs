# Load YAML Method

The `load` method allows you to retrieve data from a specific data set (YAML file) within your **verse.db** database. It's a fundamental operation for accessing and managing your data. Here's how you can use it:

### Syntax

```javascript
const dataname = "users"; // Replace with the desired data name
const result = await db.load(dataname);

console.log(result.results);
```

### Parameters

- `dataname`: The filename (without the `.yaml` extension) of the YAML file you want to load. This name is also used when performing other operations like `.add`, `.update`, `.remove`, and `.find` on the corresponding data set.

### Return Value

Certainly! Let me describe how the results of the `load` method in the **verse.db** YAML adapter look like:

The `load` method returns an object with the following properties:

- `acknowledged`: A boolean indicating whether the operation was successful (`true`) or not (`false`).
- `message`: A descriptive message indicating the outcome of the load operation (e.g., "Data Loaded Successfully").
- `results`: An array of objects representing the records within the loaded YAML file.

The `results` array contains individual objects, each representing a single record from the specified data set. These objects typically include key-value pairs corresponding to the fields and values within the data file.

For example, if you load data from a `"users.yaml"` file, the `results` might look like this:

```json
{
  "acknowledged": true,
  "message": "Data Loaded Successfully",
  "results": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "John Doe",
      "age": 30,
      "email": "john@example.com"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Alice Smith",
      "age": 28,
      "email": "alice@example.com"
    },
    // ... more user records
  ]
}
```

Each object within the `results` array corresponds to a user entry, with fields such as `"id"`, `"name"`, `"age"`, and `"email"`.

### Example

In your provided example:
- We load data from the `"users.yaml"` file.
- The `results` object contains an array of objects, each representing a single record within the loaded YAML file.

#### Outcome
The `load` method efficiently retrieves data from your specified data set, allowing you to manage your data effectively within your **verse.db** project.
