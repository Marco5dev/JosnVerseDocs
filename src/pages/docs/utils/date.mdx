# Date Handler

The **Date Handler** in **verse.db** plays a crucial role in managing date-related operations. Its primary purpose is to seamlessly handle dates and convert them to the required formats. Whether you're dealing with timestamps, string dates, or other date representations, the **Date Handler** ensures consistency and accuracy.

### Example:

Suppose we have the following timestamp:

```js
1712023669
```

The **Date Handler** transforms it into a human-readable format:

```js
4/11/2024, 12:19:17 AM
```

With this powerful utility, you can effortlessly manipulate dates, perform calculations, and maintain data integrity within your applications. ðŸ“…âœ¨
